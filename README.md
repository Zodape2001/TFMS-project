# TFMS-project

This projet is of trainning feedback management system.

## In that I have used technologies:
  - Core java, 
  - MySQL database, 
  - Maven, Junit, 
  - Logger, 
  - JDBC. 
  
## In that project my module is trainer where as admin, I should be able to: 
  - Add new trainer details, 
  - List the added trainers, 
  - Update the existing trainer details, 
  - Delete the added trainer from the system.

Also I have created login module for trainer as admin who have all the privileges and also for the trainer who don't have any privileges. The trainer as a admin he have all the privileges like add new trainer details, list the added trainers, update the existing trainer details, delete the added trainer from the system. And the trainer who don't have any privileges he only able to view his/her details only. If any trainer use wrong credentials while login he will get a message to Invalid credentials.
